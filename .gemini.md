# Project Overview

This is a multi-language monorepo containing various projects in Go, Python, Node.js, and Erlang. The entire repository is managed by Bazel for building and dependency management.

## Key Technologies

- **Build & Dependencies:** Bazel
- **Containerization:** Docker (via `docker-compose`)
- **Languages:** Go, Python, JavaScript/Node.js, Erlang

## Common Commands

### Bazel

Bazel is the primary tool for managing this monorepo.

- **Build all targets:**
  ```bash
  bazel build //...
  ```
- **Test all targets:**
  ```bash
  bazel test //...
  ```
- **Run a specific application:**
  ```bash
  bazel run //path/to/app:target
  ```
- **Query for dependencies:**
  ```bash
  bazel query 'deps(//path/to/target)'
  ```

### Docker

Many subprojects use `docker-compose` for local development environments.

- **To start a service:**
  ```bash
  # cd into the directory with the docker-compose.yml file first
  cd path/to/project/
  docker-compose up -d
  ```
- **To stop a service:**
  ```bash
  cd path/to/project/
  docker-compose down
  ```

## Project Structure Notes

- The root `MODULE.bazel` file defines the external dependencies for the Bazel workspace.
- Individual projects are located in subdirectories (e.g., `hello/`, `try-go-clean-template/`, `ical4notion/`).
- Some projects may have their own specific tooling (e.g., `Makefile` in `try-go-clean-template`, `package.json` in `ical4notion`). Always check the project's subdirectory for specific instructions.
